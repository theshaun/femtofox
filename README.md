# Femtofox &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub><sub>The tiny, low power Linux Meshtastic node

**Femtofox is a Linux-based mesh development platform - a Raspberry Pi sized computer with onboard LoRa radio, capable of being run with only 0.3w, making it *ideal* for solar powered nodes.**

The Luckfox Pico Mini is the postage stamp sized heart of the Femtofox - a compact and power efficient Linux board, running Foxbuntu, our own customized version of Ubuntu. Femtofox is an expansion of the Luckfox's capabilities, utilizing a custom PCB with a 30db LoRa radio (over 6x the transmit power of a RAK Wisblock or Heltec V3) to create a power efficient, tiny and highly capable Meshtastic Linux node.

### Features
* Tiny size (63x54mm for Femtofox, 65x30mm for the Smol Edition). Equivalent to a standard Raspberry Pi hat and Pi Zero respectively.
* Power efficient (~0.27-0.4w average, depending on radio and mesh congestion)
* Full Linux CLI (Ubuntu) via our pre-built Foxbuntu image
* Meshtastic native client support via SPI
* USB host support - attach USB peripherals
* USB wifi support
* RTC support for timekeeping
